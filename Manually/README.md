# Quote generator

The idea is a simple static website with a random quote generator. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript it should reset the quote on the page by clicking a button. Manually means it gets its quotes from a predetermined array of quote objects, each with a quote and author.

The idea is to later reproduce this quote generator but instead of using predetermined quotes, we search the internet and use FETCH.
